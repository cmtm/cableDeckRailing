== Background

My parents built a cottage about a decade ago. We've had a huge deck, but the task of installing railing has been dragging on for years. They finally set themselves to build it when we were having a large family reunion. After hearing that someone had quoted them $8000 to get it done, I told them I might be able to do it for cheaper. They agreed, and after much research, planning and construction, I finished the deck railing. This blog is an attempt to pass on what I learnt to anyone out there who's curious. I was able to do this thanks to the information out there on the internet. If this ends up being useful to you, I'd love to hear from you and see pictures of your project

== My experience

I have no experince in contruction or renovation in any sorts. I haven't even painted a wall. I've had some exposure to basic power tools such as a table saw, circular saw, and jigsaw. The most elaborate project I've completed before this was a batbox, which is like a birdhouse for bats (pretty simple stuff).

Suffice to say, I didn't know anything going into this project. So if you don't either, don't let that stop you! The main things you need are curiosity and being comfortable getting information from the internet.

== The requirements

My parents had a very large deck second story deck at their cottage. I wanted to make a good looking and inexpensive railing system. It also had to be simple since I didn't have very much experience and importantly not require and expensive tools as I didn't have any. A very important aspect was that my mother didn't want the railing to obstruct the view from the inside of the cottage. There were large windows facing the lake and if the railing was going to be right between them. 

PIC showing view

Building code specifies that the railing needed to be at least 42 inches in height measured from the ground and not allow a sphere with a diameter of 4 inches in diameter to pass through any point in the railing. These law apply in most of North America. Some places restrict the placement of horizontal members so that the railing isn't climable. As far as I could tell these laws don't apply where the cottage is but be sure to check your local building code. The railing also needs to withstand a force of 200lbs applied at any point on the railing.

== The idea

To meet the requirment of not being obstructive while still being up to code, the two options we had were glass pannels and cable railing. Neither of these two pictures are of my deck.

PIC glass railing

PIC cable railing

I decided cable railing was the better solution for several reasons. For one, it's less expensive. The second reason was that I wasn't comfortable building a glass railing system that could withstand the high winds that regularly occured there. I just didn't know enough about structural engineering to sign off on it. Cable railings also had lower maintenance (no cleaning glass) and I didn't really like the glare seen in glass panels. So cable railing it was!

== Terminology

Before we go on, let get a little bit of terminology out of the way. I started off not knowing it so if you're in the same position I was it'll be useful. Otherwise it's not entirely consistent in the industry so by putting this here there'll be no ambiguity in what I mean.

TODO: terminology

== Preliminary research

I didn't know anything about the subject so the first thing I had to do was read about... well everything. There were two parts to the railing: the frame and the cable system. 

=== The frame

==== Material
My options for frames were metal (aluminum or steel) or wood. I saw many railings made of PVC (aka vinyl), but no cable railings and I didn't want to trail blaze too much. I ended up choosing wood for several reasons.

For one, wood is easier to work with than metal and working with metal requires more expensive and dangerous tools (which I didn't have access to). Secondly after looking at the prices of making the frame from the two materials, wood turned out to be much cheaper (by an order of magnitude). While I could buy wood in an unworked state and make the components myself, I would've had to buy aluminium in a more worked since I couldn't do much myself. This contributed to the cost difference.

The drawbacks of wood were it's durability and it's obstruction of the view my mother wanted to keep so badly. While wood fits the environment of a wood cabin well, the frame members would need to be thicker since wood isn't as strong as aluminium.

This wood needed to be resistant to the elements and pests, so the two options were cedar/redwood, pressure treated wood or composite wood. A good comparison of them can be found here:
http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/how-to-plans/woodworking/4275113

I chose pressure treated wood for it's low cost and durability.




==== Construction

The frame consists of vertical posts which are attached to the deck and a top rail.

PIC posts and top rail




===== Posts

.Wood size
--
For the posts, I chose 4"x4" which is a standard size. They're actually 3.5"x3.5" though, so make sure to account for this in your plans! The other option is a 6"x6" post, but for my purposes this was unecessarily big.

PIC 4"x4" and 6"x6"
--

.Post spacing
--
After getting the post dimensions, the next thing to worry about is how far appart they'll be spaced. The farter apart they're spaced out, the less material we need (lower cost) and the less work we'll have to do. Countering this is that a lower post spacing equates to more railing strength.

PIC showing post spacing and strength

Another important factor we need to take into account is cable support. The longer the spacing between posts, the more the cable will sag and bend given a certain tension.

PIC sagging cable longer post space

There are cable railing systems which use large structural posts spaced out far and smaller cable support posts inbetween them. While these cable support posts alleviates cable saggin/flex, they do nothing to increase the strength of the railing.

PIC structural and support posts

In either case, various source on the internet suggest that there shouldn't be more than 5 ft of unsupported cable. I played it safe and opted to place structural posts at least at every 5 ft and less at most places. While using more wood than using support posts, this was simple and gave me a better assurance of the railing strength. I didn't really know what I was doing so wanted to do the most I could to ensure the railing's safety.

PIC my post spacing solution
--

.Connecting the posts to the deck
--
A chain is only as strong as it's weakest link. Likewise, the strength of the posts won't matter if they aren't securely attached to the deck. There are two different methods of making this attachment: The posts bolted onto the side of the joist or the post screwed into top of the deck boards. If screwing into the top of the deck boards, a component called a post base is needed.

PIC showing both post attachment methods

Bolting the post to the side of the joist is structually stronger so I wen't with that method. In terms of price they are about the same. I originally intended to use massive 1/2" bolts, but after arriving at my cottage and inspecting the deck, I noticed that deck builders had used two thick joists at the edges of the deck. Bolting into this would've required very long bolts (10' in my case) which would be prohibitively expensive. I instead when with TODO: {screw dimensions} lag screws. Lag screws are basically just large wood screws. 

Whatever you use, screws or bolts, make sure they're either galvanized or stainless steel. Not only is this necessary to being water resistant, but if using pressure treated wood, other metals might suffer accelerated corrosion from the chemicals used in the treatment. If using stainless steel, types 304, 305 and 316 work best with pressure treated wood. I used galvanized since they're cheaper. Stainless is more resistant to corrosion though.

The industry standard is to use two lag screws (or bolts) per post. They should be spaced as far apart as possible, while the bottom one is a good inch and a half from the bottom of the post and the top is the same distance from the top of the joist. The post should extend about 6'-8' below the deck floor. It's also good practice to offset the screws from the center to avoid splitting the wood (two screws aligned vertically highten the stress along the same grain).

.Wire rope guide holes
--
Holes are to be drilled in the posts in order to guide the wire rope they should have a diameter about 1/16" larger than the diameter of the wire rope. Some of the posts are placed at corners so the wire rope needs to bend going into or comming out of them. Metal sleeves should be interted at the holes of the post where the wire rope bend to prevent the rope from cutting into the wood when tension is applied. Without these metal sleeves, obtaining a high tension is very difficult (I learn't this the hard way) because the wire rope cutting into the wood decreases it's total required length. Tighting the rope doesn't increase the tension much because instead of increasing tension, the wire rope just makes itself a shorter path.

PIC of cutting problem?

I've found that a good solution is to slightly increase the opening size of each hole  only about a half inch deep and then using PL glue to bind an aluminum stop sleeve in the newly made opening. These stop sleves can be found at your local harware store.

===== Top rail

In the case of cable railing, the top rail serve a very important purpose that it doesn't in other railing systems: it counters the tensioning force of the cables. We'll see more about how the cabling system works later, but for now just know that the cable is somehow attached at both ends to end posts. Between these end posts, it goes through midposts. 

PIC cable going through posts

To ensure that the cable stays taught and stiff between this long run, it needs to be under a lot of tension. Remebering high school physics, newton's third law tells us that the the cable is going to be pulling just as hard on those two end posts. Multiply this force by about 11 since that's how many cables there will be joining the two posts and those posts are going to start to sag inwards.

PIC sagging end posts under tension of 11 cables

The top rail counters that tension at the top of the end posts while the deck itself counters it at the bottom. For these reasons, it's important to have a sturdy top rail.

The top rail be joined to the sides of the posts or it can attach to the top. 

PIC top rail joining post options

While the side connection is more sturdy, the top one is simpler to make since it just consists of a couple of screws straight into the top rail and into the post. The side connection requires either angled screws or a special connectors like and angle clip.

PIC angled screws or angle clip

I decided to go for the top connection, not only for it's simplicity, but because the extra height it provides coincidentally allowed me to use 12" long 4"x4" lumber for my posts and cut in into 3 pieces while still reaching the minumum 42' height. I selected 2"x4" pressure treated wood as my top rail.

PIC of top rail top joint

As with the post screws, the top rail screws need to have the same resistance to the pressure treated wood's corrosive properties, so galvanized or stainless steel.

=== The cabling system

==== The cable

This part required much more research than for the frame. Cable railing is less mature than solid member railing so there is less consistency in how it's done. For residential railing systems, the most common cable diameters are 1/8" or 3/16". The cable should be galvanized or stainless steel, with stainless being more expensive but having better corrosion resistance. If you guessed I went with galvanized, you're right! It ended up being about $0.09 per foot.

The cable we'll be using is more accurately called wire rope. Wire rope consists of many small wires. These wires can be layed out different ways. The layout is indicated by 2 numbers seperated by an 'x'. The first number indicates how many groups of wires there are while the second indicates how many wires there are per group. 1x19 would mean the wire rope is made of one group of 19 wires while 7x7 would mean 7 groups of 7 wires. I'm not sure what effect the layout has on the physical properties, but I'm thinking it has to do with the strength and flexibility. If you know let me know so I can update this tutorial. For our purposes, a cable with low flexibility is desired.

PIC wire rope layout. Ben-Mor site

The load limits of all cables from 1/8" to 3/16" should be more than high enough for our needs. The weaker of the two, the 1/8" generally has limits close to 2000 lbs of force before the cable breaks. A cable railing cable will be under a about 300 lbs of tension.

==== The fittings

The cable needs to be attached to the end posts. Several options are available and this choice will have a big effect on the total cost of installing the railing along with the level of difficulty. I'll go over all the options and compare their strengths and weaknesses.

.Options
* Fittings made specifically for cable railings:: Expensive but easy to install
* Swaged tube fittings:: Pieces are hard to find. Low cost but harder to install.
* Turnbuckle and flemish eye:: Very easy to find. Low cost, easy to install. Easy to fix mistakes.

===== Terminology

.Swaging
Swaging is a method of tightening a sleeve around a cable by crushing the fitting so that it pinches the cable. A good swage should prevent the fitting from sliding off the cable under heavy loads (even heavy enough to break the cable)


===== Specialized cable railing fittings

PIC of specialty fittings

This is the most expensive of the options by far. Some companies such as Feeney [http://www.feeneyinc.com/] or Atlantis Rail Systems [http://www.atlantisrail.com/cable-railing] produce fittings specifically made for cable railing systems. These fittings are very easy to install with many of them having a mechanism which enables the fitting to be attached to the wire rope by simply inserting it in a slot. A special locking mechanism prevents the rope from being pulled out (think of a chinese finger trap). This an old technology, and even though many of these companies claim to have patents on the auto locking mechanism, I found patents going back to the 1930s. They often just tweak it a little and then claim a new product so don't be fooled into thinking one company is the only one you can get these products from.

PIC of locking?

Each piece costs from $25 to $30. One piece is needed at each end of the rope, and there are ususally about 11 ropes per run, so you can see that at about $600 per run for just the fittings, the price goes up pretty fast. I'll cover it later, but the number of runs needed depends of the size and geometry of your deck. If you do go with this route, I would suggest you don't buy the cabling through the same company you buy the fittings with. They charge much more for what you can get for much cheaper at a hardware store or better yet a rigging shop.

===== Swaged tube (sleeve) fittings

PIC of my pieces.

This was the method I went with. Although you probably won't be able to find these pieces in your local hardware store, they're much cheaper than the specialized pieces above. I had to contact a manufacturer who then refered me to one of their distributors. The distributor seemed to be more targeted towards selling to industry than to individuals, but the employee I talked to said that I was the third guy getting pieces for a cable railing system that week. I payed $3.75 per piece for the fittings. I also had to buy a swaging tool for $50 and I also bought all my wire rope there since it was cheaper than at the hardware store. The wire ended up being $0.09 a foot.

PIC of swaging tool

These attach to the wire rope by putting it in the sleeve and then crushing the sleeve using the swaging tool see here [TODO: swaging video] for a video demontration.

TODO: embed video

The other end is then inserted through a hole and a washer/nut is placed on the otehr end. The tightening the nut then add tension to the rope. The longer the thread, the more tension that can be added so be sure to consider the thread length when buying the pieces. The thread was 2 3/4" long on mine. This is what a rope assembly would look like:

PIC of rope assembly

===== Turnbuckle and flemish eye

This is the more traditional way of working with wire rope. A turnbuckle is used to add tension and a flemish eye is used to terminate the rope.

PIC turnbuckle and flemish eye

This method is very flexible in how it's attached to the posts. A simple hook or loop with a threaded end can be screwed into a post or a more elaborate clevis fork. An advantage with this method is that it's very easy to change the rope length while keeping the pieces whereas swaged pieces can't be reused once swaged. It also allows flexibility in how much tension can be applied to the rope: long turnbuckles can be used and theu can even be put in series to multiply the length range.

A rope simple rope assembly using this method could look like this:

== My plan

=== Post layout

Because of my lack of experience, the most important thing was that I have a very complete plan of how I'm going to make the railing before even thinking of buying any materials of building anything. Any where I slacked off on the planning, I paid for it later on. My dad provided me with a sketch of the existing deck with measurements taken here is what it looked like.

PIC of sketch from father

I found a free (and open source!) 2D CAD (computer aided design) program and after reading a bit about how to use it, I put te sketch into it. My intent was to have all the post locations overlaid on top of this. Here is what my CAD drawing looked like.

PIC of CAD sketch

You can notice that stupid me made a mistake and completely ommitted one of the sections. Here is the correction with the posts overlaid onto the deck plan. I aimed to keep a consistent post spacing on each side while ensure that the post spacing didn't pass 5 feet. I had to play around with the distances to ensure that the posts would guide the wire rope around corners well.

PIC of CAD sketch with posts

You can see that while each 45 degree angle has a post at it's corner, the 90 degree corners have two posts. This is important because the wire rope isn't mean't to bend 90 degrees. Large bends will not only weaken the rope, but will add "snagging points" which make it hard to properly tension the wire rope. Have two posts close together turns a 90 degree turn into two consecutive 45 degree turns.

PIC of corner

Now you get to see an example of my lack of thourough planning costing me. I didn't draw out the top rail in my sketch. I just told myself how I'd do it and how I'd cover the corners. As described above, I made the top rail from 2x4s screwed into the top of the posts. If more than two posts could be joined by a single long 2x4, I opted to do it with the longest length possible. The only thing to plan was how the top rail would look at the corners. There are two types of corners, 45 degrees and 90 degrees. This is what I drew on a scrap piece of paper regarding the top railing joining at the corners.

PICs initial top railing joint at 45 and 90

It looks all good and dandy, but the problem is that the measurements don't acutally line up because the diagonal length of a squre is larger than the length of a side (by a factor of sqrt(2) to be exact!). I should have known at the time considering how many times I've used pythagora's theorem. I've even tutored students on it. Of well. This is what I would have seen had I actually drawn it up in my CADing program with proper dimensions.

PIC of bad joints

You'll see how I ended up dealing with this later on.

=== Post plan

In order to conform to regulations, the rail needed to be at least 42" high with no spacing greater than 4". This is what I came up with:

PIC post plan

Notice there are 11 wire ropes per run. I initially planned on using 3 runs to cover the whole deck, but due to the timing of the construction combined with my fears that the runs were too long, I instead used 5. Here are the run start/terminations  of both the first and the second plan.

PIC run depiction.

The holes in the start/termination posts needed to be larger than in the other posts since they needed to have a fitting fit through them. Also, one of the posts is both a start and a stop. This post needs to have 22 holes instead of the usual 11. You'll see what this looks like in the build part of the document.

=== Material working

I needed a needed a miller saw to cut the wood and a drill to drill the holes. I also used an impact driver to screw anything that needed screwing.


=== Stairs

I hadn't planned for the stairs at first since my father didn't have the dimensions (and I wasn't at the cottage). I only planned for them after I started construction of the rest.

=== Cutting out deck

The deck board hangs over the joist about a half inch. For the posts to lay on the joist, this half inch needs to be cut out.

PIC of pre cut and post cut out

I wasn't sure how I'd do this at first and had conflicting suggestiong from others. I ended up with a good system where I'd first cut 2 lines at the ends of my cut out and then drill a whol at one corner just big enough to fit the jigsaw blade. I'd put the jigsaw blade in the hole and then cut across. You probably have no idea what I'm talking about so here's a video of me doing it.

VID jigsaw cut out

Be sure to make the slow a little wider than the post. If it fist snugly, it's too small. This is to avoid the wood pushing agaist and misaligning the post during installation and when the wood warps.

PIC of all cut out slots (took a lot of time)

=== Installing posts

This was the trickiest part of the frame installation. The posts had to hang over the edge of the deck and be drilled in with two lag screws.

In order to install it, we created a contraption which would support it in it's place and aid in leveling it.

PIC of device and it being used

It would have been too strenuous to hold the post in place and keep it level without it. We still needed two people to install the post, even with the contraption though. One to hold the post level and one to drill.

PIC another of device?

I initially thought I could screw the lag screws in without drilling holes where they would go first, but it turned out that the screw was too thick and my impact driver couldn't produce enough torque to drive it in all the way. My drill bit wasn't as long as the screw, so I had to first screw into the post while it was held against the joist. Since the drill bit was a bit longer than the post, it would make a shallow hole in the joist. I'd then move the post out of the way and deepen the shallow hole. In retrospect I should have just pre drilled all the posts usign a template, and then drilled the holes in the joist seperately using the same template. This way, we didn't need someone holding the post there for the whole time I was drilling.

PIC of template?

Shims were used in places where the joist wasn't aligned with the vertical enough.

I hadn't planned on needing shims and I can't say I'm super happy since the solution felt makeshift, but apparently it's a pretty standard way to deal with it.

PIC of more shims?

Now we can see some pictures of all the posts installed. I hadn't done the stairs yet so you wont see posts there.
